**Help Desk Ticket: Intermittent Web Access Due to TCP Retransmissions**  

---

### Ticket Details
- **Reported By:** N. Hall (HR Department)  
- **Date/Time:** 2025-10-16 14:32 EDT  
- **System:** Desktop – Windows 11  
- **IP Address:** 192.*.*.*

### Issue Description
An HR user reported **slow web browsing and frequent timeouts** when accessing both internal and external websites.  
The challenge was to determine whether this was a simple connectivity issue or something deeper at the network layer.

---

### Steps I Took
1. Captured traffic using **Wireshark** to analyze packet behavior.  
2. Ran **ping** and **tracert** to `www.speedtest.net` to test connectivity and path.  
3. Reviewed **NIC settings** and link speed for mismatches.  

---

### Findings
- Wireshark revealed **multiple TCP retransmissions** and **duplicate ACKs** between `192.168.1.4` and `192.168.1.1`.  
- The **I/O graph** confirmed a burst of retransmissions around the 75‑second mark.  
- NIC was set to **auto‑negotiation**, while the router supported **1 Gbps full duplex**.  

---

### Remediation
- Manually set the NIC to **1 Gbps Full Duplex**.  
- Verified improved performance via ping:  
  - **0% packet loss**  
  - **Average latency: 85ms**  
- Browsing stabilized, and retransmissions dropped significantly.  
- ✅ Issue resolved.  

---

### Attachments & Observations
- **Wireshark Screenshots:**  
  - TCP handshake showing successful SYN‑ACK from `45.33.32.156`.  
  - Traffic observed on non‑standard ports (`443, 37070–37075, 22`). These appeared ephemeral and used for outbound TCP connections. Recommended monitoring for anomalies, brute force attempts, or malware.  
  - Cases where **no SYN‑ACK was received**, leading to multiple retransmissions. Possible causes: honeypot, firewall deception, or SSH filtering (verified with `nmap -sV`, manual SSH attempts, and packet inspection).  

- **I/O Graph (PDF):**  
  - Showed a **10‑second spike of packets**, suggesting retransmissions, congestion, or scanning activity.  

- **Ping/Tracert Output:**  
  - Tracert mapped the packet path to `45.33.32.156`.  
  - Ping confirmed connectivity and average response times.  

- **NIC Settings:**  
  - Changing from auto‑negotiation to **1 Gbps Full Duplex** eliminated retransmissions and stabilized latency.  

---

### Lessons Learned
This case reinforced several key points:  
- Always verify **duplex settings** when troubleshooting network performance.  
- **TCP flags and retransmissions** can reveal hidden issues like congestion, misconfiguration, or even malicious scanning.  
- Ephemeral ports and retransmission spikes may signal deeper **network or security concerns** worth monitoring.
